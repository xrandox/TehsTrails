### Core Tyria Map Completion 
A pack tailored for speedrunning map completion. It utilizes all mounts, waypoints and a multitude of markers (Over 5,000!) to give you the fastest map completion times possible. The current Core Tyria map comp world record of 8h11m utilizes this packs routing!

***

### End of Dragons Map Completion
Per my normal, the routing on these maps is intended for speed and thus is not necessarily beginner friendly. This pack is not intended for your first time to any of these maps. In fact, it is routed starting from Arborstone, like you would come in with a fresh character using the portal tome. That means NKC and TEW start from the Arborstone portals, SP starts from the water portal in NKC, and DE starts from the TEW portal. 


#### Average Map Times:
- Seitung Province: ~25 min 
- New Kaineng City: ~18 min
- The Echovald Wilds: ~30 min
- Dragons End: ~10 min

### End of Dragons Lanterns 
With EoD we got a new way to do repeatable map comp -- Jade Lanterns. Lanterns are very promising for their speed and because they allow us to repeat map comp without needing to create a new character each time. As such, many people are switching to doing lanterns instead of repeating map comp on new characters. The goal is to simply light every lantern on the map. Each lantern requires on jade bot charge to light. This pack provides you fast routing between lanterns while also making use of batteries and other jade technologies to manage your jade bot charges for you. 

#### Average Map Times:
- Seitung Province: ~22 min 
- New Kaineng City: ~14 min
- The Echovald Wilds: ~25 min
- Dragons End: ~20 min

***

### End of Dragons Hero Points Only
This routing is for those who want to quickly unlock elite specs. It provides trails to all HP's in EoD. Stealth is highly recommended to stealth commune and not need to fight the elites that guard most HP's. Otherwise, bring a decent single target build to nuke the elites before you commune. 

***

### Hero Point Trails
*Warning! This pack is still very rough, I haven't had a chance to give it much attention since I created it over two years ago.*

A collection of trails for the routes I used to use for my Hero Point Trains in HoT and PoF maps. Path of Fire can easily be used to quickly get an elite spec solo (~1-2 hours). It's recommend to bring some friends if you intend to do the Heart of Thorns HP's, as some can be difficult to solo.
